# Dot Product
dot product is written using a central dot (alt + 0183 ·)
a·b 
this is the dot product of a and b
we calc dot product of two vectors via
a·b = |a| * |b| * cos(θ)
where |a| is the magnitude of vector a
|b| is the magnitude of vector b
θ is the angle between a and b
*OR*
a·b =  (a.x × b.x) + (a.x × b.y)

The first method is more accurate but the accuracy is negligible after rounding.

a · b = 10 × 13 × cos(59.5°)\
a · b = 10 × 13 × 0.5075...\
a · b = 65.98... = 66 (rounded)\
**VS**\
a · b = -6 × 5 + 8 × 12\
a · b = -30 + 96\
a · b = 66
