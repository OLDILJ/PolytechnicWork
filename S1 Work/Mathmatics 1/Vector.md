## Vectors

A Vector is a Line

It has magnitude (**Scalar**) and direction

![vector-mag-dir](https://github.com/OLDILJ/PolytechnicWork/assets/161396140/b51dd88c-1a39-44f9-9538-5bb4668ebf64)

You add two vectors by joining them head to tail

subtracting vectors is different.
1. first we reverse the direction of the vector we want to subtract
2. then we add them as usual

Vectors are generally written in **BOLD**
they can also be written as the letters of its head and tail with an arrow above it.

You can add vectors by adding the x parts and the y parts together.

**c = a + b**

**c** = (8, 13) + (26, 7) = (8+26, 13+7) = (34, 20)

when you break up a vector each part is called a component.

magnitude is shown by two pipes on either side of the vector
|a|
or as double pipes (so its not confused with absolute value)
||a||
we use pythag to calculate it
||b|| = √( 62 + 82 ) = √(36+64) = √100 = 10

A scalar has magnitude ***only.***

Full working example:
**A + B + C + D**\
**A** = (3, 2)\
**B** = (1, -3)\
**C** = (1, 0)\
**D** = (-2, -2)\
ans.x = (3 + 1 + 1 - 2) = 3\
ans.y = (2 - 2 - 3 + 0) = -3\
ans = (3, -3)
