## Multiplication Principle
When there are **M** ways to done one thing \
and **N** ways to do another \
then there are **M x N** ways of doing *BOTH* \
e.g. **3** shirts and **4** pants. \
that means **3 x 4** = **12** different outfits. \

This also works with ***More than 2 options***
e.g. Buying a car. \
There are **2** body styles: \
**5** colors available \
and **3** models \
we can do a **TREE DIAGRAM** to help. \

or do a simple calculation:
**Total Choices = 2 x 5 x 3 = 30** \
**However** this only works when all choices are *Fully independant of each other* \
if one choices affects another choice (i.e. **depends** on another choice) then a simple multiplication is not right. \
e.g. Buying a car. pt2.
The salesman says "We dont have black for the hatchback".

We now only have **27** choices. \
we can still do a calculation however: \
**Choices = 5x3 + 4x3 = 15 + 12 = 27**
