# Database Proposal
##### By Logan J. Olding


My database will be about a tool to help visualize a generic RPG battle.
The system will offer an overview of all parts of a generic RPG Battle.
There will be data about: Heroes, Monsters, and their relevant statistics (Health,Damage,Skills,Speed,Int)
The user will have to manually input all data to suit their specific needs. But there will be some default data in place.
This database will be helpful for Developers fine tuning entity stats for a more engaging fight, Players who want to experiment with different character builds without creating a new save.
This will mostly be aimed towards Developers, Hardcore Players, Dungeon Masters, And anyone else who has a baseline understanding of common rpg statistics.
after a couple cursory searches I can only the main alternatives all cost money to use this is mainly underneath the rpgmaker brand which not only costs a large amount of money but also requires a basic understanding of game development to create battles. while this database does not require any knowledge of game dev.
