Non verbal communication is an underutilzed aspect of interacting with people. 
This essay will go over the what, why, and how non verbal communication works and how it is slowly being unlearnt by the general population.

Non verbal communication is any form of communication done through body gestures, facial movement, personal space, the clothes you wear, and more.
Each of these parts contribute greatly to the overall conversation contributing nuance where words can't get the full meaning across.
For example depending on the clothes you wear you portray a different image of who you are.
A person wearing a pressed suit, tie, and dress pants tends to portray an image of class or style thats simply not there in a bloke wearing an old sweater and trackies.
This also ends up influencing their attitude too. each of these two would act differently if they wore different clothes the suited person wouldnt seem so high class and conversely with the trackie bloke.
Body gestures are a more obvious form of non verbal communication this ranges everything from hand gestures to acting something out, you probably already use Body gestures every single time you talk to someone in person.
Body gestures are also generally universal allowing you to have a conversation with someone who doesnt understand you or you dont understand them.
Like pointing at something, putting up two fingers to indicate two of something, no words are needed but its still easily understood.
You can easily have entire conversations with randoms without saying a word just communicating through purely non verbal means.

However Non verbal communication is slowly being faded out as we move further away from talking to people in person instead prefering to communicate from online platforms either social media or text mostly.
Even video calls where you are able to see the person through a screen and see some non verbal communication
