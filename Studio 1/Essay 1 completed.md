Non verbal communication is an underutilzed aspect of interacting with people. 
This essay will go over the what, why, and how non verbal communication works and how it is slowly being unlearnt by the general population.

Non verbal communication is any form of communication done through body gestures, facial movement, personal space, the clothes you wear, and more.  
Each of these parts contribute greatly to the overall conversation contributing nuance where words can't get the full meaning across.<sup>[[1]](## "Hull, Raymond H. PhD. The Art of Nonverbal Communication in Practice. The Hearing Journal 69(5):p 22,24, May 2016. | DOI: 10.1097/01.HJ.0000483270.59643.cc ")</sup>  
For example depending on the clothes you wear you portray a different image of who you are.
A person wearing a pressed suit, tie, and dress pants tends to portray an image of class or style thats simply not there in a bloke wearing an old sweater and trackies.<sup>[[2]](## "Ames, K.L., 1980. Material culture as nonverbal communication: A historical case
study. Journal of American Culture 3 (4), 619–641. doi:10.1111/j.1542-
734X.1980.0304_619.x.")</sup>  
This also ends up influencing their attitude too. each of these two would act differently if they wore different clothes the suited person wouldnt seem so high class and conversely with the trackie bloke.  

Body gestures are a more obvious form of non verbal communication this ranges everything from hand gestures to acting something out, you probably already use Body gestures every single time you talk to someone in person.  
Body gestures are also generally universal allowing you to have a conversation with someone who doesnt understand you or you dont understand them.  
Like pointing at something, putting up two fingers to indicate two of something, no words are needed but its still easily understood.  
You can easily have entire conversations with randoms without saying a word just communicating through purely non verbal means though do expect alot of mimicking each others actions.<sup>[[4]](## "Hess, Ursula. (2016). Nonverbal Communication. Encyclopedia of Mental Health. 10.1016/B978-0-12-397045-9.00218-4.")</sup>  

However non verbal communication is slowly being faded out as we move further away from talking to people in person instead prefering to communicate from online platforms either social media or text mostly.<sup>[[5]](## "Valkenburg, P. M., and Peter, J. (2009). Social consequences of the internet for adolescents: a decade of research. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 18, 1–5. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01595.x")</sup>  
Even video calls where you are able to see the person through a screen and see some non verbal communication.  
You still end up losing a large part of it due to you only being able to see the top half of their body, so you cant see any form of non verbal communication that uses the lower half like posture, clothes and personal space.<sup>[[6]](## "Neureiter, K., Fuchsberger, V., Murer, M., and Tscheligi, M. (2013). “Hands and eyes: how eye contact is linked to gestures in video conferencing,” in Proceedings of the CHI ‘13 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, eds W. E. Mackay, S. A. Brewster, and S. Bødker (New York, NY: Association for Computing Machinery), 127–132.")</sup>  
There are some things you can do to get closer to full non verbal communication while staying virtual but they are all impractical for general usage.

This wouldnt be that important if Non verbal communication was just a small part of talking to others and only helped with small nuances, this is not the case.
Non verbal communication is vital in any environment.  
It helps with gauging engagement to see if your talks are being well received, for helping others in a situation where you are unable to speak to them, to let a boss know if their employees are doing their job correctly or just about anything that relies on talking to another person.  
In situations where people were forced to work together without non verbal communication they performed far worse at complex tasks then those who could see each other and do non verbal communication.<sup>[[6]](## "Michael, Plumb. (2013). NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION IN INSTANT MESSAGING. https://www.suu.edu/hss/comm/masters/capstone/thesis/plumb-mi.pdf")</sup>

In Conclusion Non verbal communication while something that I initially thought was an underutilized aspect of interacting with people is used far more often than I expected.  
However people are slowly forgetting how to fully utilize it as we transition to more abstract forms of communication.
